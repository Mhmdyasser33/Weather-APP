Weather App in React is a simple and user-friendly weather application built using the React JavaScript library. It allows users to search for weather in any city around the world and displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition. The app also features a five-day forecast for the selected city and the ability to save frequently searched cities for quick access. The weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API and the app is open source, welcoming contributions and bug reports
